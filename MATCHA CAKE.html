                <p align="justify"> <b>1.</b> Pre-heat oven to 325 F.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>2.</b> Soften cream cheese in the microwave on medium for 10 seconds. It should be at a spreadable consistency.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>3.</b> Sift together cake flour, matcha powder, baking powder and salt. Sift 3 times to ensure leavening agent is evenly dispersed throughout dry mixture. Stir to incorporate. Set aside.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>4.</b> In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat sugar and room temperature butter together on medium speed until pale and fluffy.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>5.</b> Add softened cream cheese into mixture, beat on medium-low until incorporated. Do not over beat.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>6.</b> Add room temperature eggs one at a time and beat on medium-low until it looks smooth and creamy.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>7.</b> Pause mixer, add dry ingredients into the wet batter in 3 separate additions. Beat on the lowest setting ("stir" on some machines) until almost all of the dry ingredients inside bowl are no longer visible.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>8.</b> Turn off mixer, take the bowl out and scrape down the sides, gently fold in the rest of the dry ingredients by hand.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>9.</b> Transfer batter into an 8.5" X 4.5" loaf pan lined with parchment paper.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>10.</b> Bang the pan on the counter several times to remove excess air.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>11.</b> Bake for 40-50 minutes until the cake springs back in the center when gently pressed and a skewer inserted comes out clean. The cake will look golden brown.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>12.</b> Let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>13.</b> Once cooled, keep cake at room temperature for 2-3 days in an air tight container. If placing in the fridge, let it come back to room temperature before serving, about 20-30 minutes.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>14.</b> Serve it alone or with ice cream or Azuki bean paste. Enjoy!</p>
