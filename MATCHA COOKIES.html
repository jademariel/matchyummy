                <p align="justify"> <b>2.</b> In a small bowl, stir together the flour, matcha powder, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>3.</b> In a large mixing bowl, use an electric hand mixer to beat softened butter until very creamy. Add sugar and cream together with the mixer until very creamy and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>4.</b> Add in the eggs and vanilla extract and mix again until combined.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>5.</b> Add the flour mixture into the butter mixture and briefly mix with the hand mixer until almost combined with some flour patches left.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>6.</b> Add the chopped chocolate and finish folding the dough together with a silicone spatula until just combined. Don't overmix.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>7.</b> Using a 4-tablespoon ice cream scooper, scoop out balls of cookie dough and place them on your baking sheet, leaving about 2" between each cookie for spreading.</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>8.</b> Bake cookies for 12-14 minutes or until the edges are set but the middle is still very soft. In the last 2 minutes of baking, press a few extra white chocolate chunks on top of each cookie (optional).</p>
                <p align="justify"> <b>9.</b> Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before carefully transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
